# Privacy Policy

**Last updated:** 18/12/2025

This Privacy Policy explains how this website, alexholt.uk, (the “Site”) handles information when you visit it.

---

## 1. Overview

The Site does not intentionally collect, store, or process personal data from visitors. There are no user accounts, contact forms, comment sections, analytics tools, or tracking cookies implemented by the Site itself.

However, limited data may be processed indirectly through the Site’s hosting provider and through third-party services used to display publicly available statistics.

---

## 2. Data Collected by the Site Owner

The Site owner does **not**:

* Collect personal information from visitors
* Use analytics or tracking technologies
* Use third-party cookies
* Store IP addresses, identifiers, or behavioural data
* Allow users to submit content or data

As such, no personal data is collected directly by the Site.

---

## 3. Third-Party Services

### 3.1 Hosting (Cloudflare Pages)

The Site is hosted using Cloudflare Pages. As part of providing hosting, security, and content delivery services, Cloudflare may process certain technical data, such as:

* IP addresses
* Request metadata (e.g. browser type, date and time of access)

This processing is performed by Cloudflare independently and is subject to Cloudflare’s own privacy policy and data protection practices. The Site owner does not control or access this data.

### 3.2 Third-Party APIs

The Site displays certain statistics retrieved from third-party APIs. These APIs may change over time.

Currently, the Site may retrieve data from services such as:

* Gaming platforms
* Language learning platforms
* Code hosting platforms

Examples of such services include Steam, Duolingo, and GitHub.

The data retrieved relates solely to the Site owner’s own accounts and activity, or to data which is publically avaliable.

When a visitor accesses the Site, requests made to these third-party services may result in those providers receiving limited technical data, such as IP addresses or standard request headers. Any such data collection or processing is carried out by the relevant third-party service under its own privacy policy and terms of service, and not under this Privacy Policy.

The Site owner does not control, receive, or store any personal data collected by third-party APIs.

Each third-party service operates as an independent data controller for any data it processes.

### 3.3 Links to Third-Party Websites

The Site may contain links to third-party websites or services that are not operated or controlled by the Site owner.

Any information you provide to, or that is collected by, third-party websites is governed by their own privacy policies and terms. The Site owner is not responsible for the privacy practices or content of third-party sites.

Visitors are encouraged to review the privacy policies of any third-party websites they visit.

---

## 4. Cookies

The Site may use first-party cookies that are strictly necessary for basic functional purposes, such as ensuring proper loading, security, or performance of the Site.

These cookies are not used for tracking, profiling, advertising, or analytics.

Third-party services involved in hosting or content delivery (such as Cloudflare) may also use cookies or similar technologies for their own functional, security, or performance-related purposes. Any such usage is governed by the relevant third party’s privacy and cookie policies.

---

## 5. Legal Basis (UK GDPR)

To the extent that any personal data is processed by third parties in connection with the operation of the Site, the legal bases relied upon may include:

* Legitimate interests in ensuring the security, performance, and availability of the Site
* Compliance with legal obligations by third-party service providers

The Site owner does not independently determine the purposes or means of such processing.

---

## 6. International Data Transfers

Although the Site is operated from the United Kingdom and is intended primarily for a UK-based audience, it may be accessed globally.

Third-party service providers (such as Cloudflare) may process data outside the UK. Where applicable, such transfers are safeguarded by appropriate legal mechanisms, as determined by those providers.

---

## 7. Data Retention

The Site owner does not retain any personal data relating to visitors.

Any data retention performed by third-party service providers is governed by their own policies.

---

## 8. Your Rights

Under UK data protection law, individuals may have rights in relation to their personal data, including rights of access, rectification, and erasure.

As the Site owner does not collect or control personal data, requests relating to data processed by third parties should be directed to the relevant service provider.

---

## 9. Changes to This Privacy Policy

This Privacy Policy may be updated from time to time to reflect changes in the Site, applicable law, or third-party services used.

Any updates will be posted on this page, with the “Last updated” date revised accordingly.
