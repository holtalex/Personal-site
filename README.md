# Personal-site

Hello!
My name is Alex, and here is a little website that I put together.

It is a constant work in progress, but I hope you like it!

I also don't really mind if you don't, because it's my website. And I bet you don't have a website. Not that there's much need to, it's just fun.

Feel free to take a look at my code, see how stuff works (or doesn't), and if you really, *really* want to, you can even take some snippets to use in your own projects. I wouldn't recommend it, as there's probably much better code you can find out there in the world wide web, but you can.

Enough reading, go take a look!
